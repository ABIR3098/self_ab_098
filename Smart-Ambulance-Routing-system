Smart Ambulance Routing System
🚀 Project Overview

The Smart Ambulance Routing System is a Java-based application designed to find the fastest and safest route for ambulances in emergency situations.
It uses graph algorithms (like Dijkstra’s Algorithm) to calculate the shortest path between intersections on a city map, ensuring timely arrival at hospitals.

⚙️ Key Features

🚗 Real-time route visualization — Displays ambulance movement on a simulated city map.

🗺️ Graph-based road network — Each intersection and road is represented as nodes and weighted edges.

⏱️ Shortest path calculation — Uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the optimal path.

🏥 Hospital destination — Automatically directs the ambulance to the nearest hospital node.

🎨 Interactive UI — Simple 2D Java Swing interface for route and map visualization.

🧩 Technologies Used

Library: Java Swing / AWT

Algorithm: Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / NetBeans

Version Control: Git & GitHub

🎯 Project Goal

To build a system that can assist emergency response vehicles by automatically determining the quickest route through city traffic, improving response time and saving lives.
